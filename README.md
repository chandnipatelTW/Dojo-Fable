# Instructions

This code has been shamelessly lifted and slightly modified from
the Fable samples at https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/tree/master/samples

1. Install node.js / npm: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. From this folder (Dojo-Fable/), run `npm install`
3. Now run `npm start`
4. After a few seconds, open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser and you will see
   a big square, generated from the Dojo-Fable/canvas/canvas.fsx code
5. Any change you make to the F# code will be automatically reflected on the web page.
   Press Enter on your terminal to stop the local server and Fable/Webpack watch.
6. Profit! Now let's make some more fancy stuff happen in canvas.fsx :)
